                <h1>What is Shea Butter?</h1>
                <p> Shea butter is very thick and solid at room temperature but has a buttery rich consistency that
                    makes it ideal for use as a natural eye cream, lip balm, or body butter. Many studies show that it
                    is especially good at penetrating the skin and contains 60% fat, making it highly emollient.</p>

                <p> Thanks to some other special properties, shea butter does more than moisturize, it delivers key
                    anti-inflammatory and anti-aging components right into the skin.</p>

                <h2>What are the Benefits of Shea Butter </h2>
                <p> Moisturizing: The concentration of natural vitamins and fatty acids in shea butter makes it
                    incredibly nourishing and moisturizing for skin. It is often used to remedy dry skin and to help
                    protect the skin’s natural oils.</p>
                <p> Reduces Inflammation: A 2010 study found that due to its cinnamic acid and other natural
                    properties, shea butter was anti-inflammatory. One compound in particular, lupeol cinnamate, was
                    found to reduce skin inflammation and even potentially help avoid skin mutations. This also makes
                    it beneficial for some people with acne.</p>
                <p> Skin Smoothing: Shea butter aids in the skin’s natural collagen production and contains oleic,
                    stearic, palmitic, and linolenic acids that protect and nourish the skin to prevent drying. With
                    long-term use, many people report skin softening and strengthening as well as wrinkle reduction.</p>
