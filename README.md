For my project, I created a shea butter informational website where people can find information about the product and contact us for their shea butter needs, questions, concerns, and comments.
CSS and Javascript files are linked to the html file. 
Those files are also attached to the project. 

CSS and JavaScript:

The CSS file contains all the styling for the website.

JavaScript was used to creat a contact us form for clients to reach out to us for more information. It was also used to animate the subtitle background color change by changing the background color every 3 seconds.
